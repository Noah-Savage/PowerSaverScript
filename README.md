# PowerSaverScript
Script to change power plan to Power Saver

Original script was found somewhere else but I cannot relocate the original author. 
I just changed it to change to Power Saver instead of High Performance and updated 
that it indeed works with Windows 10.

Also added portion near end to start/kill my RGB software for my AIO pump, not relevant to actual power scheme changes
